        <h1>Realist Chambers Statutes</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>In law context, statutes is a written law passed by a legislative body, such as congress or state legislature. Here are some small details about statutes:
            <br>
            1. Codification: statutes are often codified, meaning they organised and published in a systematic way, making it easier to reference and understand. <br>
            2. Section numbers: Statutes are typically divided into sections or subsections, each with its own unique number or designation. <br>
            3. Effective dates: Statutes often have specific effective dates, indicating when they become enforceable. <br>
            4. Amendments: Statutes can be amended or modified by later legislation. <br>
            5. Repeal: Statutes can be repealed, or abolished, by later legislation. <br>
            6. Interpretation: Statutes are subject to interpretation by courts, which can affect their application and enforcement. <br>
            7. Jurisdiction: Statutes typically apply within a specific jurisdiction, such as a state or country. <br>
            8. Penalties: Statutes often prescribe penalties or consequences for non-compliance. <br>
            9. Definitions: Statutes may include definitions of key terms to clarify their meaning. <br>
            10. Severability: Statutes may include severability clauses, allowing parts of the statute to remain in effect even if other parts are deemed unconstitutional.
